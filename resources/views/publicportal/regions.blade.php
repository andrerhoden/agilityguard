Upon taking many CE courses every year the Las Vegas Institute for advanced Dental Studies provided Dr Bastian a platform to meet some great mentors like Dr Clayton Chan, Dr Robert Jankelson, Dr James Gerry along with countless other colleagues looking to "up the ante" of not only their practice but the quality of their lives. In our office we love the patient that comes in for a second opinion because we know what we tell them going to be completely different. We love the patient that comes in with the ever so common complaint that "I had this work done recently and it just never felt right" we can almost always provide an adjustment that has these patients convinced that we just performed magic. We love what we do and have fun with our colleagues, our team and especially our clients. I am honored to be invited by Dr. Clayton Chan as one of the premiere regional center facilitators supporting Occlusion Connections teachings. &nbsp;</p>

                      <p>Dr. Derek M. Okamura graduated in 1994 from the University of Manitoba. His active lifestyle and love of the outdoors prompted him to move to Vancouver, B.C. in 1996 where he currently practices. His established Vancouver office focuses on TMD, Neuromuscular Orthodontics and Chronic pain. <br>He first began his interest in core stability in his exercise regime due to occupational pain. In addition, he suffers from TMD and understands the pain caused by the condition. He broadened his focus to consider all aspects of a healthy lifestyle to include eating organic and local foods and reducing environmental and occupational toxins. The natural progression of his holistic philosophy in health and wellness extends to his passion for dentistry. <br>His area of special interest is core stability and its relationship to both proper occlusal loading and atlas alignment. Subsequently, Dr. Okamura has focused his continuing education in these areas and has attended Occlusion Connections, LVI, Seattle Institute, Loudens Orthodontic Seminars, and Pankey. &nbsp;Dr. Okamura is located at&nbsp;2635 West Broadway, Vancouver BC V6K 2G2. &nbsp;<strong>Phone:&nbsp;(604) 736-2124. &nbsp;Email: drokamura@agilityguard.com</strong>
