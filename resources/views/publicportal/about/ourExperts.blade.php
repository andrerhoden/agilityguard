  <h2>Nick Theodorou, ND</h2>
  <p><strong>“</strong>
  <em><strong>Having trained Olympic and World Class athletes for over twenty years now, I know that the key to success in sports is development of the human neuromusculoskeletal system. When I learned that the AgilityGuard is a neurodental device, I was immediately intrigued and had to try it. While wearing the Trophy AgilityGuard, my strength, strength endurance and power are all significantly increased! </strong>
  </em>
  </p>
  <p><em><strong>"On March 19th, 2011, I participated in the Pennsylvania State Powerlifting Championships held in Lansdale, PA. Weighing in at a lean 73.5 kilos (162.0 pounds) and at the age of 60, I easily established two new American Records in the 60 - 64 year age category - a squat of 170 kilos (374.8 pounds) and a deadlift of 230 kilos (507.0 pounds). The squat broke the previous record by some 66 pounds and the deadlift by some 39 pounds! Both lifts were quite easy thereby setting the stage for the next competition. Having competed for many years now, and knowing how these two poundages normally "feel", I can attest that the AgilityGuard </strong>
  <strong>increased my ability to focus and recruit major motor units thereby increasing strength, strength endurance and power! I highly recommend that any athlete, at any age, consider using the TAG as a method of legal performance enhancement!"</strong>
  </em>
  </p>
  <p><em><strong>I consider the AgilityGuard to be a safe, legal and effective ergogenic performance enhancement aid. Therefore, I strongly recommend it to any athlete who is serious about winning!</strong>
  </em>
  <strong>”</strong> – Dr. Nick Theodorou, ND.</p>
  <p>A lifelong resident of Palmer Township, PA, Dr. Nick in 1981 was one of the founders of the American Drug Free Powerlifting Association (ADFPA, renamed USAPL), the oldest and largest Powerlifting organization in the country, Dr. Nick regularly gives seminars on drug-free weight training, as well as healthy lifestyles, to local schools and other organizations.
