  <p>Apolo Anton Ohno began his short track career in 1995, and it took him less than two years to become the best short-track skater in the United States. At 14, after training under Pat Wetland in Lake Placid for just six months, Ohno claimed his first overall title at the U.S. Championships. Ohno's success made him a likely candidate to make the 1998 U.S. Olympic Team, but the American struggled with his fitness throughout the 1997-98 seasons and finished 16th at the Olympic Trials. </p>
  <p>Apolo committed himself to making the 2002 Olympic squad, and by the 2000-01 seasons he was one of the world's best skaters. The Seattle native won the World Cup title in the 500m, 1000m, and 1500m en route to winning the overall crown, making him the first American to win a World Cup title at any distance.</p>
  <p>Apolo is an 8-time Olympic medalist (2002, 2006, &amp; 2010), and 7-time World Cup event Champion, 3-time World Cup overall champion (2001, 2003, 2005), and 7-Time U.S. short track overall champion (1997, 1999, 2001, 2005).  </p>
  <p>Apolo's versatility has seen him win on the TV show Dancing With the Stars in 2007, write a book on his life. "Zero Regrets", &nbsp;and start his own supplement business, 8Zone.<br> </p>
