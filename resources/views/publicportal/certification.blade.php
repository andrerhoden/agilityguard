            <p>There are two levels of Certification to be able to offer AgilityGuards:</p>
            <ul><li><strong>Phi AgilityGuard:</strong> entry-level product, no specialized equipment/experience necessary.&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Trophy AgilityGuard*:</strong> requires TENS unit. Contact us if you require information on getting TENS unit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may wish to be certified for both types of AgilityGuard as you are able to offer them at different prices. For a description of  the differences between the two AgilityGuards, please review the <strong>Products</strong> section of this website.</p>
            <h3>GETTING STARTED</h3>
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Decide which level(s) of certification you wish to pursue.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Register for the online AgilityGuard certification level of your choice - Phi, Trophy or both (see Registration link below). You must pay the Certification Fee in full (see below) and register for the relevant training course by following the link below.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Welcome to the TAG Team - once you have registered and taken the online training course, we will assign you to a Regional Facilitator to assist you with any technique, administrative or marketing questions.</p>
            <p><strong>Note: If you wish to receive CE credits for the course, then there is a minimum grade of 70% which you must achieve. You are able to attempt the tests more than once. You are able to become an AgilityGuard-certified dentist in any event once you have completed the training material.</strong>

            <h3>REGIONAL FACILITATOR SUPPORT:</h3>

            <h3>Hands-On Regional Training Sessions:</h3>
            <p><strong>Phi AgilityGuard certification</strong>:  there is no-hands on Regional Facilitator training requirement, although Regional facilitators are always available as a resource to consult with you and to share best practices, success stories, tips and techniques.</p>
            <p><strong>*Trophy AgilityGuard certification</strong>: hands-on training may be required depending on your experience in TENS and your familiarity with the Chan-Optimized Bite.  We will review with you to make a joint determination as to whether you would benefit by attending a hands-on session with your Regional Facilitator.</p>
            <p>Regional Facilitator Training will cover:</p>
            <ul><li>Chan-Optimized Bite: hands-on demonstration of this very precise technique that requires practice and experience, and is significantly different from other bite-taking techniques.</li>
            <li>Agility Test Best Practices: the most powerful consumer sales tool in your arsenal. Make it a standard part of your patient exam and watch the excitement and referrals build.
            </li>
            <li>Practice Integration: fostering AgilityGuard team sales environment, campaigns and information exchange.
