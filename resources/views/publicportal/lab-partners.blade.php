        <p>Since Las Vegas Esthetics' founding in 1997, the cornerstone of our philosophy - to consistently provide excellent products and service - has remained in place. Guided by this philosophy, we develop superior, high-end products for our clients every day. To that end, we have worked very closely with Dr. Chan and Dr. Andary, with assistance from our fellow Labs, Space Maintainers and Esthetic Alliance, to develop the exacting methodology by which AgilityGuards are fabricated.</p>
        <p>A dental laboratory acclaimed for its exacting standards, LVE remains squarely focused on providing superior service to the dental community. We believe that the most effective way to do this is to form a partnership with you, the dentist, so that you and your clients can fully benefit from our unparalleled experience and expertise. We strive to be more than your dental lab; we want to be a valuable, knowledgeable partner that anticipates your needs and consistently delivers effective and innovative products.</p>
        <p>We define a successful case as one in which the restoration is precise, your chair time is minimal and your patient is thrilled with the results. Delivering successful cases to exacting standards is what we do, for you and your patients, every day.</p>
        <h2>Esthetic Alliance</h2>

        <p>Esthetic Alliance dental lab was formed by dentists for dentists. By having experienced cosmetic and reconstructive Gneuromuscular dentists on staff, Esthetic &nbsp;Alliance is bridging the gap between the doctor and technician. Constant feed back and oversight between the doctor and laboratory technician have made Esthetic Alliance unique amongst dental labs. Having been personally trained by Dr. Clayton Chan, the Esthetic Alliance technicians are current on the latest Gneuromuscular protocols. </p>
