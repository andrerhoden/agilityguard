              <h2>Agility</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.agilityguard.com/assets/images/system/images/0000/0931/ApoloOhno2_medium.jpg" title="Apolo Ohno2" alt="Apolo Ohno2" rel="medium" class="rounded float-left" /></p>
              <p>As 8-time Olympic medalist Apolo Anton Ohno will attest, every athlete, player, trainer, coach and fitness enthusiast is aware of the benefits of being "agile". Agility is defined as the ability to change the body's position efficiently, requiring the integration of isolated movement skills using a combination of balance, co-ordination, speed, reflexes, strength, endurance and stamina.&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h3 class="clearfix">Not a New Idea - Just one who's time has come!&nbsp;</h3>
              <p>The potential to improve athletic performance by using a properly designed mouthguard <strong><em>is not a new idea</em> </strong>. Dentists have, for some 40 years, noted improvements in athletic performance when athletes used a properly designed mouthguard.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Still, for many, wearing a mouthguard while playing contact sports is viewed simply as a way to protect the teeth. Football Players, Boxers, Hockey Players, MMA Athletes and others can all be seen wearing (and often chewing on) their mouthguard on the field, on the ice and in the ring.&nbsp;It used to be that if you played a sport where you could get hit, you wear a mouthguard - any mouthguard - plain and simple and no thought required.</p>
              <p>While few serious athletes would consider competing with the wooden racquets of the 1970s, the shoes of bygone eras or outdated equipment in general, it is not uncommon to see today's athletes using mouthguards little changed from their parents' competitive days. Surely, there must be a better way!</p>
              <h3>Now there's AgilityGuard: Performance Protection</h3>
              <p><img src="http://www.agilityguard.com/assets/images/system/images/0000/2461/AgilityGuard_-_Performance_Protection_large.png" title="Agility Guard   Performance Protection" alt="Agility Guard   Performance Protection" rel="large" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" /></p>
              <p>Technological advancements have in fact redefined the importance and role of mouthguards in sports.&nbsp;With a focus on precision, durability and comfort, each AgilityGuard is truly custom fit to unleash the performance potential of the most important athlete in the world - You!</p>

              <h3 class="gold"><em>Important to Note</em></h3>

This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em> </p>
