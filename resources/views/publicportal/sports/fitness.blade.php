I raced with the mouthpiece and won. The next training block, I thought I'd train without it. Suddenly, my results and performances plateaud.  After a terrible performance racing without it, I went back to AgilityGuard and noticed that everything began to improve once again.  The AgilityGuard is essential"</p>

As I began the 4 day adventure race in Chile, I was not sure what to expect with AgilityGuard. What came about during a 10.5 hour run on day 3, then a 5 hour run on day 4 was something I can hardly explain. With AgilityGuard, we ran fast, we glided and we leaped for 10 hours to a resounding victory."</p>

              <p class="t_quote">I have used it for almost every swim session in the last 8 weeks and swimming is where I have made the most improvement.  Breathing with it is no different for me if I am using it. I have noticed when swimming that my neck and shoulders are much more relaxed and my core is aligned from head to toe which helps my body position in the water.  I am swimming faster but the biggest difference is that I can hold my relative speed for much, much longer.  That is specific to the nature of long course triathlon swimming! On long rides or runs I take out the AG when I need to eat.  No time lost and I have done many sessions over 8hrs like this without dropping it or having issues eating or drinking."&nbsp;

Mark provides the following feedback:"Triathlon is a sport of many elements. In order to reach the peak of performance in the sport, one must develop quickness, endurance, power, speed, and technique in the three disciplines of swimming, cycling, and running. Additionally, to reach the elite levels of triathlon, one must find a way to maximize fitness and performance daily. To do so, an athlete must constantly find ways to improve upon weaknesses and continue to train and develop strengths. After several years of developing and maintaining my peak form in the sport of triathlon, I have finally found a unique product that has made a substantial difference in both my training and my performance."</p>

              <p>The AgilityGuard is one of the greatest discoveries I have made this year in enhancing my athletic performance. I am excited to see what new levels I can reach in my training and competitions with the help of AgilityGuard."</p>
              <h3><em>Important to Note</em>
              </h3>
              <p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
