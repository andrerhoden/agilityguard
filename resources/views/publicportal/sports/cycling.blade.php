<p class="t_quote">"Within about 20 minutes of using AgilityGuard for the first time, I noticed improved mechanics on the bike. I have found myself much more centered on the saddle and less sore after training or competitions. My body recovers faster and without the fatigue commonly experienced. Further, my abdomen and back have gained strength as muscle recruitment from these areas has improved. Overall, I am recovering much faster between rides thanks to the improvement in efficiency with AgilityGuard."</p>

<p class="t_quote">"Agility Guard is now my secret weapon of choice. Never having experienced any issues or problems with my
mouth or jaw, I was skeptical at how the AG would improve my performance. I put the trust in my coach though, as he was absolutely convinced I needed
one. After having the AG for 6 weeks now and using it regularly in training (both in the weight room and on my bike for interval sessions) I have been
mesmerized with the results. First off, I notice a much improved sense of balance and center of gravity. This was not something I struggled with
before, but now I feel so "planted" on the bike or on the leg sled as if I my hips weigh 1000 pounds and nothing can knock me off center. Its very
settling to feel this way. Second, I notice a different calm about which I perform my training. With the AG in my mouth I experience this smooth,
controlled calm confidence and my mind is centered and never struggling or in panic mode.  Before AG, when I would get to my last few lifts or last
interval, I would feel stressed and shaky and concerned that I would not be able to finish the set strong, or be able to do it at all. Now with AG I
feel like I could always do another interval or set, AFTER I am finished with the work for the day. Its amazing. I am a big fan and I will not
perform my event without my AG in my mouth and I cant wait to take it to the Olympics and tell other athletes about it from many other sports.
Thank you AG!!"</p>

<p class="t_quote">"I picked up my AgilityGuard a few days before the State TT Championships but was reluctant to wear it... I said, "what the hell" and gave it a shot. Well... I PR'd and won the California State Time Trial Championships!  My power increase was 30 watts higher than last year. The AgilityGuard is my new best friend."</p>

<p class="t_quote">"I had been using the AgilityGuard for 6 weeks in a base strength training cycle and decided to put it to the test on a familiar course with the same objectives I had in the past. The results were amazing in performance number terms and, as a coach, to see such a jump in base strength was unbelievable. The AgilityGuard has the potential to help every athlete in every sport, particularly cycling."</p>

<h2>Maximum Peak Power and Sustainable Peak Power</h2>
<p>Maximum peak power (explosive power) is, in Giddeon's view, &nbsp;"of huge importance.. the magic number being 25 watts/kg body weight. The higher the explosive power, the faster we can attain  top speed".&nbsp;&nbsp;In longer races, this may be important to break away from the pack.</p>
<p>Sustainable Peak Power is, as well, of great &nbsp;importance in Giddeon's view -&nbsp;<em>"the longer we are able to maintain this power or close to it, the longer our sprint. For longer races, being able to maximize threshold sustainable power is key."</em>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Balance and Flexibility</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/system/images//0000/0769/Giddeom2010-2_medium.jpg" title="Giddeom2010 2" alt="Giddeom2010 2" rel="medium"></p>
<p>Balance is important for many cyclists, and flexibility allows you to get into positions that may provide you with a race advantage.</p>
<h2>Range of Motion</h2>
<p>We have been told that an increased range of motion/range of vision, provides a tactical advantage on being able to see more fully where your competitors are around you, and to give you a sense of positioning in the pack. </p>
<h2>Endurance and Recovery</h2>
<p>These are priority attributes for cyclists. We do not have empirical evidence to support enhanced endurance and recovery, but have been told by users that they have found that they have better endurance and recover more quickly. These are areas that we would want to pursue for empirical evidence.</p>
<h2>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Expected Research</h2>
<p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques.  Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
<h3><em>Important to Note</em>
</h3>
<p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
