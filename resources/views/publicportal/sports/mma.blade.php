          		<p class="quote">In 2006, Dr Hoa Nguyen, a Taekwon-do expert and AgilityGuard Dentist, represented Canada in the 7th Junior / 2nd Veteran International Taekwon-do Federation (ITF) World Championships held in Sofia, Bulgary, where he won a Gold Medal in his category. He states that &nbsp;"balance, flexibility, range of motion are all very important in martial arts, especially in TKD where kicks are emphasized. In TKD, there are lots more kicking techniques than hand techniques.  In these techniques, balance, speed, power, range of motion decide their effectiveness, and loose/relaxed muscles are required for highest effectiveness.</p>
              <p>Combat athletes require a broad spectrum of qualities such as dynamic range of motion, agility, quickness, strength, power, recovery and endurance. As well, they require mouthguard protection when in combat. AgilityGuard is the best-of-class performance mouthguard that offers both optimal athletic performance and mouthguard protection.</p>

              <h2>Strength</h2>
              <p>It’s the core of every combat athlete. And every little bit helps. With Triumphant on your team, you’ll have an immediate advantage over your opponent from training day straight through to game day. </p>
              <h2>Speed</h2>
              <p>Imagine always being one step ahead. Accelerating, reacting, and competing faster than before. Improve your overall speed and reaction time and you’ll improve the way you play. AgilityGuard™ gives you the explosive edge you’ve always wanted.</p>
              <h2>Balance</h2>
              <p>With better balance you’ll step when you want to step, move when you want to move and stand your ground when it counts the most. Improved balance and alignment can mean increased accuracy, and a more consistent, centred performance.  </p>
              <h2>Agility</h2>
              <p>Being more agile means staying light on your toes and ready to make your move. Explode from a stand still, stop on a dime and take your game to a whole new level with a little help from AgilityGuard™. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   </p>
              <h2>Endurance and Recovery</h2>
              <p>Play longer, run harder and increase your tolerance to take more pain. The pain that comes with being a champion. With help from AgilityGuard™ you may be able to train harder, recover faster and improve your performance where it counts.  </p>
              <p>We do not have empirical evidence to support enhanced endurance and recovery, but have been told by users that they have found that they have better endurance and recover more quickly. These are areas that we would want to pursue for empirical evidence.</p>
              <h2>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Expected Research</h2>
              <p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques.  Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
              <h3><em>Important to Note</em>
              </h3>
              <p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
