              <p>Liam Ortega, who in 2007 made the US National Speed Skating Team, and who suffered a serious head injury thereafter, is a recent AgilityGuard user. <em>" I started using the AgilityGuard in October, 2010. I immediately noticed a positive impact on my training, and have exceeded my own speed expectations&nbsp;and those of my coaches. More importantly...I felt very relaxed and balanced.  I skated 2x 5km under my personal best for the distance and was pretty stoked.  Things have been progressing in a positive direction since, and I am excited to see how I progress. &nbsp;It has had countless performance benefits."</em>

          <h2>Kimani Griffin</h2>
          <p class="t_quote">“I have noticed a significant improvement in my balance, strength, breathing, posture, and technique. Whether our training day consists of weightlifting, extensive bike rides, on-ice workouts, or dryland (off-ice) workouts, I always use my AgilityGuard. My mouthpiece allows me to skate lower, faster, and effortlessly, as well as giving me the ability to bring my heart rate down faster post-workout. The first day training with my mouthpiece on-ice, I instantly shaved a half second off of my fastest lap time. The last competition of the season, in which I wore my Agility Guard, I took over a half second off of my 500-meter personal best, two full seconds off of my 1000-meter, and over two seconds off of my 1500-meter personal. You do the math”</p>

            <p class="t_quote">“The AgilityGuard helps me in those aspects of my skating that demand explosive power, like starting and sprinting. I am noticing a difference when pushing off each stride. Importantly, my AgilityGuard allows me to get into a lower position and become more balanced, leading to better overall dry land exercising.”</p>

              <h3>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Expected Research</h3>
              <p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques. Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
              <p><strong>Important to Note</strong> <br>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</p>
