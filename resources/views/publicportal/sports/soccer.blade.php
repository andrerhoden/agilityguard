          		<p>Agility is perhaps the most important requirement of any soccer player, regardless of position played. The fundamental elements of good play rest on agility.</p>
<ul><li>Dribbling requires that the player have speed, and to very quickly change direction with bursts of speed. Dribbling involves a combination of dynamic stability and explosive power.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Running to the play call upon your quickness, and by your ability to accelerate rapidly. &nbsp;Being agile permits you to get started on your run with greater efficiency.</li>
<li>To be a good tackler, you need to be able to get on and off the ground more precisely, and to escape the opposing player once you win control. To resist and counter tackling, you need to have good balance and speed, and the ability to accelerate rapidly.</li>
<li>Nothing is perhaps as important as finishing the play. Being in the right spot requires that you have the ability to get there. Once there, good balance and agility allow you to resist attempts to dislodge you. Heading the ball is also assisted by improving the strength and range of motion of your neck.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Strength and Power</h2>
<p>Kicking &nbsp;and heading the ball with power is an advantage. A faster moving ball is more likely to evade the opposing goalie. Being strong gives you an edge in one-to-one encounters with the opposing player.</p>
<h2>Speed and Acceleration</h2>
<p>Improve your overall speed and reaction time and you’ll improve the way you play. AgilityGuard™ gives you the explosive edge you’ve always wanted.</p>
<h2>Balance</h2>
<p>With better balance you’ll step when you want to step, move when you want to move and stand your ground when it counts the most. Improved balance and alignment can mean increased accuracy, and a more consistent, centred performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Endurance and Recovery</h2>
<p>Play longer, run harder and increase your tolerance to take more pain. The pain that comes with being a champion. With help from AgilityGuard™ you may be able to train harder, recover faster and improve your performance where it counts.  </p>
<p>We do not have empirical evidence to support enhanced endurance and recovery, but have been told by users that they have found that they have better endurance and recover more quickly. These are areas that we would want to pursue for empirical evidence.</p>

<h2>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Expected Research</h2>
<p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques.  Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
<h3><em>Important to Note</em>
</h3>
<p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
