          		<h3 class="quote">The USGA recently ruled on the use by golfers of AgilityGuards, allowing for use by golfers under certain circumstances. Your AgilityGuard Dentist is able to provide you with a copy of the ruling.</h3>

              <h2>Core Strength and Stability</h2>
              <p>A recent study published by Dr Greg Wells of the Department of Physiology and Experimental Medicine at the University of Toronto suggests that core strength and stability, flexibility, balance, and peripheral muscle strength are correlated with golf performance ("Physiological Correlates of Golf Performance", J. Strength Cond. Res., 2009 May; 23(3), 741-50).&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Wells study revealed varied significant associations between  abdominal muscle endurance and driver carry distance and average putt distance after a chip shot., and after a sand shot. Golfers have reported experiencing increased driving distance and driving accuracy while wearing a neuromuscular mouthguard.</p>
              <h2>Flexibility&nbsp;</h2>
              <p>The study indicates varying significant associations between flexibility and driver carry distance, 5-iron ball speed, 5-iron carry distance and score. &nbsp;While we do not have empirical evidence to make a claim of increased flexibility, users have reported to us being more flexible.&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Balance</h2>
              <p>The Wells study shows varying significant links between balance and greens in regulation, and average putting distance after a chip shot. There are empirical studies which suggest a relationship between jaw position and posture.</p>
              <h2>Explosive Power</h2>
              <p>Wells illustrates, among other things, &nbsp;varying significant links between peripheral muscle power (vertical jump, number of push ups on 60 seconds, and grip strenght) and driver ball speed, driver distance, greens in regulation and sand shot performance. The results differed between males and females.A recent study by Rutgers University suggests improved explosive power with the use of a neuromuscular mouthguard that was based on Dr Chan's techniques.</p>
              <h2>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Potential Research</h2>
              <p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques.  Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
              <h3><em>Important to Note</em>
              </h3>
              <p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
