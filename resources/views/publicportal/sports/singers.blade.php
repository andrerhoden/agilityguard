          		<p>As many singers and dancers are well aware, proper head and body posture directly influence oxygen intake and overall efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the book, "Dynamics of the Singing Voice", Bunch explains in lucid terms the importance of proper head and body posture to singing.</p>
<p>Good posture allows a singer to get a deep, full breath. Slouching, or being too rigid, has an impact on the diaphragm and can deprive the singer of a good breath. It is easier to take and use an efficient breath when your body is correctly aligned.</p>
<p>Lennon et al have commented (see "Posture and Respiratory Modulation of the Autonomic Function, Pain and Health" AJPM, 1994; 4: 36-39 ) that "because posture affects breathing, it also affects vocal sound. If sound is not &nbsp;optimally vocalized, the individual does not experience optimal vocal expression".</p>
<p>In dancing, it is important to have proper alignment of posture and turnout in order to have balance.</p>
<p>As Teri Loren notes in her book, "The Dancer's Companion" &nbsp;(Doubleday, 1987), poor alignment puts stresses and strains on the joints and muscles of the lower back and legs, causing muscles to work beyond their natural capacities, joints to carry more weight, and ligaments to lose their elasticity.</p>
<h2>What are Singers Saying About the AgilityGuard?</h2>
<p>The executive management of Tanjola, a Toronto-based full service all rights music management company, requires each of their artists to use AgilityGuards for training in order to achieve peak fitness. Managing Partner, Ivan Berry, notes that touring imposes great physical demands on his artists, and he has not come across any product that comes close to matching the benefits to his artists of using an AgilityGuard.</p>

    <p><strong>Shiloh</strong> is one of the most popular young singing sensations around.&nbsp;She is fresh and unapologetically original. From the first time you hear Shiloh, you will be hooked on this 16-year-old’s unique brand of righteously original rock n’ pop. With a fierce voice twice her size – and attitude to match – this defiant singer-songwriter delivers an authentic take on her generation. Shiloh works hard at keeping in shape to meet the many demands placed on her in building her career. Shiloh, who has chosen to use an AgilityGuard as part of her fitness training routine, says that "I' ve been using my mouthgaurd while I work out, and within the first day of using it I noticed a difference in how my body was responding... I have more energy, less "after workout muscle pain", and I feel stronger. I can lift heavier, run longer, breathe deeper. I even used it when I swam once, and it helped me concentrate and hold my breath longer. It's kind like my little magic secret to being super human, haha."&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Shazelle</b>, a young and rising pop star from the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, states that &nbsp;"When I first heard about the AgilityGuard, I was very skeptical. However, two close friends were using it and I saw the difference they experienced with it, which really got my interest. Now that I have one of my own... it is nothing short of amazing! There has been an immediate effect on my flexibility and range of motion, and it gives me that extra push to do more and for longer. Sometimes I feel like I just can't get tired. The AgilityGuard has made a huge positive difference in my workout, and now nothing is ever difficult... just merely a temporary challenge."</p>

<h3><em>Important to Note</em> </h3>
<p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em> </p>
