<p>When my strength and conditioning coach John Schaeffer first told me about the AgilityGuard, I was a little skeptical. After training and fighting with an AG, I' ve noticed a significant improvement in my balance, breathing and most of all - power.  I am able to "go lower" into my punches, and deliver them with more devastating power. With my AG, I now feel complete. I have won my last 3 fights by KO, and improved my record to 17-0, and as a result, I am soon to be fighting for a world title.The AgilityGuard is now an essential part of my equipment. My recommendation to any athlete wanting to perform better or to take their training to the next level - Get yourself an AgilityGuard!</p>

<h2>Strength and Power</h2>
<p>It’s the core of every hardcore boxer. When you call upon your body to move, your muscles need to have the power to comply with your instructions. When you punch your opponent, you want to make it count.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Speed and Acceleration</h2>
<p>Quickness - the sweet skill of a boxer - allows you to move in and out, avoid punches, punch quickly, and rapidly. Accelerating, reacting, and competing faster than before. Improve your overall speed and reaction time and you’ll improve the way you play. AgilityGuard™ gives you the explosive edge you’ve always wanted.</p>
<h2>Balance and Flexibility</h2>
<p>With better balance you’ll move when and where you want to step, and stand your ground when it counts the most. Improved balance allows you to stay on your feet and maintain control. It centers you better when you punch. Being flexible better allows you to move your body out of the line of fire.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Agility</h2>
<p>Being more agile means staying light on your toes and ready to make your move. Explode from a stand still, stop on a dime and take your game to a whole new level with a little help from AgilityGuard™. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   </p>
<h2>Endurance and Recovery</h2>
<p>Boxing is a sport of intermittent, but dramatic, physical and mental demand, full of intense bursts of physical activity. It requires great endurance during a round, and the ability to recover quickly between rounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not have empirical evidence to support enhanced endurance and recovery, but have been told by users that they have found that they have better endurance and recover more quickly. These are areas that we would want to pursue for empirical evidence.</p>
<h2>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Expected Research</h2>
<p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques.  Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
<h3><em>Important to Note</em>
</h3>
<p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
