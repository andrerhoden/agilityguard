          		<p>Whether for performance shooting, real-life self defense or a combat situation - agility, focus, strength and calm under pressure are vital. &nbsp;The ability to generate peak performance under pressure is a combination of many factors including reaction time, hand-grip strength, endurance and concentration. AgilityGuard has provided the performance advantage to an impressive and growing group of individuals who demand the best when it is all on the line.</p>

    <p>"The AgilityGuard continues to amaze me. I now have a mouthguard that is both protective and performance enhancing. Consider that shooting at speed is directly related to controlling recoil, and to do this strength is a factor. AgilityGuard allows me to have better transmission of nerve impulses that control a large portion of the motor functions I use during shooting. My grip strength, ability to get more aggressive on the gun, and my ability to shoot faster and maintain accuracy all improve with AgilityGuard!"</p>

    <p class="t_quote">"I recently participated in the Revolver World Championship having not shot a revolver in approximately one year. With zero expectations and very little practice I came home with a 2nd place finish. The AgilityGuard was a huge help especially with regard to hand strength - no fatigue and no muscle failure. This is huge!"</p>

<h2>Balance</h2>
<p>With better balance you’ll step when you want to step, move when you want to move and stand your ground when it counts the most. Improved balance and alignment can mean increased accuracy, and a more consistent, centred performance.  </p>
<h2>Agility</h2>

<h2>Endurance and Recovery</h2>
<p>Play longer, run harder and increase your tolerance to take more pain. The pain that comes with being a champion. With help from AgilityGuard™ you may be able to train harder, recover faster and improve your performance where it counts.  

</p>
<h2>AgilityGuard Specific Experience and Expected Research</h2>
<p>AgilityGuard users consistently report increased flexibility, balance, core strength and explosive power. A recent study published by Dr. Shaun Arents and others of Rutgers Univeristy. "Effects of a neuromuscular dentistry- designed mouthguard on muscular endurance and anaerobic power", Comparative Exercise Physiology, Cambridge University Press, 2010, suggests an enhancement in peak power output, performance and repeated maximal efforts by individuals using a mouthguard based on Dr Chan's techniques.  Triumphant is looking at pursuing formal research on the potential of the AgilityGuard to improve flexibility, balance, endurance, recovery, core strength and stability among other attributes.</p>
<h3><em>Important to Note</em>
</h3>
<p><em>It is important to understand that each individual is different, and that only you can determine whether an AgilityGuard would provide any potential improvement in your athletic performance. This is best determined by you visiting an AgilityGuard dentist nearest you and having him or her perform the Agility Test on you. Only then should you make a decision to purchase an AgilityGuard.</em>
